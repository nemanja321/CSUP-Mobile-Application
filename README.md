About Aplication

An application that makes it easy to buy online bus tickets Without waiting in lines and with one click it solves everything
I had some basis from last year but I changed everything and almost made a brand new application (the basis was for a taxi, and this is for bus tickets)
The first Layout is to log in to a profile you already created in Layout to create
You already use the second Layout to choose your departure point and where you think you are going, and the novelty is that the third function allows you to choose the route (via which city you want to go)
Example: You select Podgorica as the starting station, go to Budva terminal and choose to go via Cetinje because this route suits you
He calculates the price of your trip by clicking on pay and reservation
It opens the next Layout for you to choose what you want to pay with Paypal or credit card
In the end, you are thrown out of your ticket, which can later be scanned into the bus and not hold drivers' time
It is possible to add gps on buses as well as this option of bus monitoring.
